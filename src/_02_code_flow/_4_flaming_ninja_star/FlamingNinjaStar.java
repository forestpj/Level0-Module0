		// Set the robot window size to 800 x 800

		// Use a for loop to repeat all of the code below ONE time (we will change this later)

			   // TURN RIGHT     Turn the robot 1/8 of a circle (hint: 360 degrees will turn a full circle)
		
			   // DRAW           Move the robot 64 pixels

			   // TURN LEFT      Turn the robot 40 degrees to the LEFT. (Negative numbers will turn the robot counter-clockwise.)
			
			   // DRAW FLAME     Move the robot the distance in the variable flameSize
			
				//               Turn the robot 170 degrees
			
				//               Move the robot the distance in the variable flameSize (again)
			
			   // TURN RIGHT     Turn the robot 64 degrees to the right
			
				// DRAW          Move the robot the distance in the variable baseSize
		
		// TEST   Run the program. Check that your shape is the same as the first picture in the recipe. 
		//        This is one arm of the ninja star.
		
		// COLOR  Change the Robot's pen color so that the flame is a different color to the rest of the star.
		//        Run the program again. Check the second picture in the recipe.

		// LOOP   When you have one arm looking right, change your for loop to repeat 25 times.
